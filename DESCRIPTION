Description: Generates three inter-related genomic datasets: methylation, gene expression and protein expression having user specified cluster patterns. The simulation utilizes the realistic inter- and intra- relationships from real DNA methylation, mRNA expression and protein expression data from the TCGA ovarian cancer study, Chalise (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.02.011>.
